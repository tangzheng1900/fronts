        As the government publishes the legislation that will allow for an in/out EU referendum by the end of 2017, the
        prime minister will visit The Hague, Paris, Warsaw and Berlin before an EU summit next month.

        The Guardian view on the Queen’s speech: it all comes back to Europe
        Editorial: The legislative programme traipses across all sorts of fields, mixing the good, the bad and the ugly.
        It felt directionless, but in truth everything was geared towards the EU referendum
        Read more
        The prime minister meets his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte over lunch in The Hague on Thursday, followed by talks
        at the Elysée Palace in Paris with the French president, François Hollande. On Friday, he visits the Polish
        prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, in Warsaw before flying to Berlin for talks with Angela Merkel, the German
        chancellor.

        The tour comes after the government unveiled its principle measure in the Queen’s speech – a bill to permit the
        first referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU since 1975.

        The bill will confirm that the government has accepted the advice of the Electoral Commission on the referendum
        question. Voters will be asked: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?” This
        contrasts with the question in the Tory private members’ bill in the last parliament which asked: “Do you think
        that the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union?” The commission suggested that this question
        risked confusing some voters who might not have realised that the UK is already a member of the EU.

        The question means that the campaign to stay in the EU will be the yes side while the anti-EU campaign will be
        the no side, the reverse of the Scottish referendum in which the status quo – to remain in the UK – was the no
        side.

        The prime minister made clear that all members of his government would be bound by his negotiations as he hinted
        that ministers may also be expected to campaign on the same side in the referendum campaign. He told MPs: “The
        government have a very clear view, which is that we believe that the right answer is reform, renegotiation and
        referendum. We go into that believing that Britain will be successful. That is the view of all the government
        and every government minister.”

        As he prepared for his tour of EU capitals, Cameron was warned of the challenges ahead when French newspaper Le
        Monde reported over the weekend that Hollande and Merkel have agreed that reforms to the eurozone should be
        delivered under the EU’s current treaties. The decision means that Cameron is unlikely to secure the “full-on”
        treaty change he demanded in January. British sources have suggested recently that he might press for a legally
        binding protocol. This could be attached to a future revision of the Lisbon treaty or to the next accession
        treaty for a new EU member state.

        The prime minister is planning to demand change in four broad areas. He wants to:

        Bar unemployed EU migrants from claiming benefits and force EU migrants in employment to wait four years before
        claiming in-work benefits. This will be resisted in Warsaw.
        Hand the UK an opt-out from the “ever closer union” declaration.
        Ensure that EU member states outside the eurozone, such as the UK, could not have changes to the rules of the
        single market imposed on them by eurozone countries.
        Give national parliaments the right to club together to block new legislative proposals.
